<h3 align="center"> Welcome to my personal website! </h3>

<p> I am a bioinformatics scientist with 9+ years experience in computational biology with expertise in <i>“multi-omics” </i>research. I analyze <strong>high throughput biomedical data</strong> from complex experimental designs to study the genetics of cancer. </p>

<p> I have a PhD in the field of evolutionary genomics and computational life sciences. My technical expertise is in advanced computing, data science and statistics, UNIX-based command line tools, and programming languages like Bash, R, and Python. </p>

I work at the [Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research](https://frederick.cancer.gov) on the [CCBR](https://bioinformatics.ccr.cancer.gov/ccbr/) core team.
