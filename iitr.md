I completed my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR), where my scientific journey truly began. IITR shaped both my intellectual foundation and research mindset through a rich mix of coursework, lab training, and field-based research experiences.

My research career was launched during the final years of my undergrad through hands-on work in the Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery Laboratory under Dr. Naveen Navani and Dr. Ranjana Pathania. Over two years, I worked on multiple interdisciplinary projects focused on bioremediation, environmental microbiology, and antibiotic resistance.

Key highlights of my undergraduate research:

Bioremediation of pesticide-contaminated soil using a novel Pseudomonas strain capable of metabolizing chlorinated pesticides like imidacloprid, endosulfan, and coragen—both in vitro and in soil microcosm models. This work led to my first scientific publication.

Groundwater bioremediation modeling near a fertilizer plant through a project with the Department of Hydrology, IITR.

Selection and analysis of antibiotic resistance genes from pesticide-impacted soil microbiomes—my undergraduate thesis, which was awarded the Institute Silver Medal for Best Bachelor's Project (2014).

These experiences nurtured my early fascination with molecular evolution, microbial adaptation, and data-driven biological inquiry—interests that would eventually guide me into genomics and bioinformatics.

Beyond academics, IITR was where I developed a deep appreciation for exploration—both scientific and personal. Proximity to the Himalayas led to unforgettable adventures in Rishikesh, white-water rafting, and long-distance motorbike trips. The energy, rigor, and creativity of that time continue to influence how I think and work today.
