My role as an assistant project coordinator involved contributing to the formulation and implementation of Plan India's Early Childhood Care and Development project. I assisted in developing project plans, including timelines and resource allocations, to ensure optimal efficiency in our efforts.

A significant aspect of my work was facilitating training for beneficiaries, including pregnant and lactating mothers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), and Anganwadi workers (AWWs). By equipping these individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills, I aimed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the project and improve the health and well-being of children in the community.

Additionally, I contributed to surveys, budget spreadsheets, and Gantt charts for the analysis and assessment of project performance. This analytical work was crucial for understanding the impact of our initiatives and ensuring that we remained accountable to our goals. I also had the responsibility of preparing the Annual Report for the Early Childhood Care and Development project for the year 2015, which provided a comprehensive overview of our achievements and challenges.
