</div>


I am a computational biologist currently working as a **Bioinformatics Analyst** at the [National Cancer Institute (NCI)]((https://www.cancer.gov/)). I am a part of the [Center for Cancer Research Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR)](https://bioinformatics.ccr.cancer.gov/ccbr/) — a specialized team supporting investigators across the NIH's intramural cancer research programs. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from Purdue University, where my research focused on understanding genetic load, functional diversity, and adaptive potential in small or endangered populations. As a Welder Wildlife Fouundation Graduate Research Fellow, my work combining whole-genome resequencing, simulation modeling, and theoretical genomics has been recognized with multiple national awards, including the 2024 Society for the Study of Evolution's Presidents’ Award for most outstanding dissertation publication. 

Following my doctorate, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at The Ohio State University, studying host immune responses to emerging fungal diseases in endangered rattlesnakes using multi-tissue RNA-seq data. My research has contributed to conservation planning through collaborations with state wildlife agencies and I have published over 15 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals including PNAS, Evolution, and Molecular Ecology.


My technical expertise spans R, Python, Bash, and high-performance computing, with deep experience in NGS analysis, genome assembly, and multi-omics integration. Passionate about applied genomics and interdisciplinary science, I bridge fundamental evolutionary theory with practical insights in wildlife management and biomedicine. I am also an invited speaker, mentor, and peer reviewer committed to advancing open and collaborative science.
