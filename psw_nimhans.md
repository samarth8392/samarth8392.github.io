### Comprehensive Assessments and Collaborative Care

In my role as a full time Psychiatric Social Work and Junior Consultant at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), I conduct comprehensive assessments and provide therapeutic interventions for patients, placing a strong emphasis on trauma-related issues. This involves a thorough understanding of each patient's unique circumstances and challenges, allowing me to tailor interventions that address their specific needs. By utilizing evidence-based practices, I strive to create a supportive environment that fosters healing and recovery.

Collaboration is a key aspect of my work, as I engage with multidisciplinary teams that include psychiatrists and psychologists. Together, we develop effective treatment plans and strategies that integrate various therapeutic modalities. This collaborative approach ensures that patients receive holistic care that addresses both their psychological and social needs. By working closely with other professionals, I can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of each patient's situation, ultimately enhancing the quality of care provided.

### Advancing Mental Health Care and Addressing Social Factors

My commitment to advancing the field of mental health extends to my participation in research projects and capacity-building activities. By contributing to the development of evidence-based practices, I aim to enhance the effectiveness of interventions and promote a deeper understanding of mental health issues. Engaging in research not only enriches my own knowledge but also allows me to contribute to the broader field, ultimately benefiting patients and communities.

I also recognize that mental health is deeply intertwined with social factors. That’s why I work closely with the social welfare benefits team and external agencies to address patients’ legal, financial, and housing issues. These challenges can significantly impact a person’s mental health, and I believe it’s essential to provide comprehensive support that goes beyond clinical interventions. By advocating for my patients and connecting them with the resources they need, I help create a more stable and supportive environment for their recovery.

Counseling is another critical component of my work, where I deliver support to patients and their families using various therapeutic approaches tailored to their specific needs. This personalized approach ensures that each individual feels heard and understood, fostering a sense of trust and safety. By addressing the emotional and psychological challenges faced by patients and their families, I aim to empower them on their journey toward healing.

### Mentoring Future Professionals and Community-Based Rehabilitation

In addition to my clinical responsibilities, I am actively involved in teaching and supervising post-graduate students. This role allows me to facilitate their understanding of psychiatric social work practices, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for their future careers. I take pride in mentoring the next generation of professionals, sharing insights from my own experiences, and encouraging critical thinking and compassionate practice.

Ultimately, my goal is to facilitate the successful rehabilitation of patients through community-based interventions. By engaging with local resources and support systems, I help patients reintegrate into their communities, promoting resilience and independence. Through a combination of clinical expertise, collaboration, education, and advocacy, I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact in the lives of those I serve.
